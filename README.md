- Hi, I’m Angus McDonald
- I'm a back-end developer with experience in Python/Django
- I'm self-taught and have recently completed a project building the back-end to an ecommerce website.
- I'm currently working on building a tool to help friends of mine more easily manage thier holiday homes. I.e. which loved one is staying at the property, when and for how long. <a href= https://github.com/banga87/OurLittleCottage>REPO HERE</a>
- I'll be building the back-end first and plan on learning HTML, CSS and Javascript to build a beautiful and extremely easy to use front-end once I get there.
- I'm based in Sydney, Australia and am available for work.
- Get in contact with me via email - angusroymcdonald@gmail.com
