# Hey, I'm Angus 👋

CTO & Founder building AI-powered products at the intersection of automation and real-world services.

## What I'm Building

### 🌱 Grassmaster Gus

An AI-powered lawn care ecosystem — think smarter lawn management for both homeowners and service businesses.

- **B2B Platform** — AI-driven quoting, CRM, and route optimisation for lawn care businesses. Snap photos on a property walkthrough, and the platform generates accurate quotes using computer vision, satellite imagery, and equipment-aware pricing.
- **B2C Mobile App** — Personalised lawn care coaching with AI chat, photo diagnosis, treatment plans, and activity tracking tailored to local grass types and growing conditions.

**The thesis:** Lawn care businesses still quote jobs with gut feel and spreadsheets. We're replacing that with AI that understands turf, terrain, and the tools in your trailer.

## Tech Stack

```
Frontend     React Native (Expo) · React · TypeScript
Backend      NestJS · Supabase · PostgreSQL
AI/ML        LangGraph · Multi-agent architectures · Claude API
Maps         Google Maps · MapBox (property measurement & boundary drawing)
Infra        Vercel · Supabase Edge Functions
Tooling      Claude Code · Custom subagents · n8n automation
```

Full JavaScript/TypeScript across the entire stack — deliberately chosen to maximise AI tooling integration and developer velocity as a small team.

## How I Work

- 🤖 Heavy believer in AI-assisted development — I use Claude Code extensively with custom skills and structured documentation systems to ship production-ready code fast
- 🏗️ I build comprehensive systems with solid architecture docs before writing code
- 🔬 Obsessed with multi-agent AI workflows — currently deep in LangGraph for orchestrating complex real-world tasks like quote generation
- 🚀 Ship early, iterate constantly, let real users break things

## Beyond Code

- 🇦🇺 Based in Australia
- 🎮 Gaming when I'm not coding — Factorio, Oxygen Not Included, Arc Raiders, Satisfactory, Sons of the Forest
- 🍖 BBQ and Mediterranean cooking enthusiast
- 🐕 Training a cavoodle puppy (the hardest debugging I've ever done)
