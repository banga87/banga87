- 👋 Hi, I’m @banga87
- 👀 I'm going through a huge career change learning to code via online courses.
- 🌱 I'm focussing on Python because it gives the quickest path to that magical feeling of making things come alive without complicated syntax. I'll move on to Java or C+ at some point if the career deems it neccessary.
- 💞️ I’m looking for a mentor to help push me to achieve great things.
- 📫 How to reach me: angusroymcdonald@gmail.com
