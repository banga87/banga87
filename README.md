- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Angus McDonald
- ðŸ‘€ I'm going through a huge career change learning to code via online courses.
- ðŸŒ± I'm focussing on Python because it gives the quickest path to that magical feeling of making things come alive without complicated syntax.
- I've been working through various algorythms and data structures completing tasks on Leetcode.
- I've also been teaching myself Django by building a backend to a shopping cart.
