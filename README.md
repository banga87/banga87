## Hey, I'm Angus

Founder building tools for trades businesses that still run on gut feel and spreadsheets.

### What I'm Building

#### Grassmaster Gus

A quoting tool for lawn care businesses. The problem is simple: most operators don't actually know what a job costs them to deliver. They know their hourly rate. They know what competitors charge. But they don't know the real cost of running their equipment — depreciation, fuel, maintenance, consumables, finance payments — broken down per job.

**Gus fixes that.** Enter your equipment, and Gus calculates what it actually costs you per hour to run each machine. When you quote a job, you're quoting from real numbers, not guesses.

The tagline: **Know your costs before you quote.**

Gus will integrate with the tools operators already use — job management platforms like ServiceM8 and Jobber, accounting software like Xero and QuickBooks. It doesn't replace those tools. It sits alongside them and makes the quoting side smarter.

### Tech Stack

```
Frontend:  Next.js · React · TypeScript
Backend:   NestJS · Supabase · PostgreSQL
Infra:     Vercel · Supabase Edge Functions
```

Full TypeScript across the stack — chosen to maximise AI tooling integration and developer velocity as a small team.

### How I Work

- Build comprehensive architecture docs before writing code
- AI-assisted development with Claude Code, custom skills, and structured documentation systems
- Ship early, iterate constantly, let real users break things

### Beyond Code

- Based in Australia
- Gaming when not coding — Factorio, Satisfactory, Oxygen Not Included
- BBQ
- Surfing
- Training a cavoodle puppy (harder than any production bug)
