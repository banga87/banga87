<h2>Background</h2>
Enthusiastic and accomplished professional transitioning into Software Development after a successful career in Sales, Operations, and Entrepreneurship in Tech and SaaS companies. Equipped with a solid understanding of business operations, project management, and team leadership, I am eager to bring these skills into a development role. A self-taught coder, I am looking to integrate my professional experience with my newly acquired skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Python, Django, and PostgreSQL to contribute to an innovative software development team.

<h2>My Value Proposition</h2>
With over a decade of professional experience in Sales, Sales Management, Operations, and leading my own tech startup, I offer a unique perspective to the developer role. My deep understanding of business operations, team dynamics, and the software development life cycle, combined with my technical skills, allows me to approach problem-solving from a comprehensive perspective. I'm well-equipped to understand client needs, work effectively in team environments, and contribute to strategic planning.
